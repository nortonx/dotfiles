# Review only the code committed on this branch

## Usage

/commandname [arguments]

- Look for errors, broken logic, inconsistent code,
antipatterns, violation of the DRY principle, and breaking 
changes in the code that was updated or created in this specific branch.
- Show me a review with the filename, line number where the issue was found, 
what would be the fix, and explain the quick wins and improvements.
- **Do not change code. Just show the review.**
- Use neutral but a little informal tone. Be polite.

## Mentoring

- Code review can have an important function of teaching developers something new about a language, a framework, or general software design principles. It’s always fine to leave comments that help a developer learn something new. Sharing knowledge is part of improving the code health of a system over time.

## Principles

- Be respectful and constructive in your feedback.
- Focus on the code and its functionality, not the developer.
- Provide specific examples and suggestions for improvement.
- Be concise and to the point.
- Be open to feedback and willing to learn from others.
- Be patient and understanding.
- Technical facts and data overrule opinions and personal preferences.
- If no other rule applies, then the reviewer may ask the author to be consistent with what is in the current codebase, as long as that doesn’t worsen the overall code health of the system.
